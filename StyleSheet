		Style Sheet for the PartyPay Softwre code in PHP
		

->Overview

	- Codes MUST follow PSR-1.
	
	- Codes MUST use tabs, equivalent to 4 spaces for indentation.
	
	- The lines MUST be 80 characters or less.
	
	- MUST be a blank line after the namespace declaration and MUST be a blank line after the 
	  block of statements to use.
	  
	- Opening keys for classes MUST be placed on the next line and lock keys MUST be placed on 
	  the line after the body of the class.
	  
	- Methods opening keys MUST be placed on the next line and lock keys MUST be placed on 
	  the line after the method body.
	  
	- Visibility MUST be declared in all the properties and methods; abstract and final MUST 
	  be declared before the visibility; static MUST be declared after the visibility.
	  
	- Control structures keywords MUST have a space after them.  Methods and functions calls 
	  NO.
	
	- Opening keys for control structures MUST be placed on the same line and lock keys MUST be 
	  placed on the line after the body of the control structure.

	- Opening parentheses for control structures MUST NOT have a space after them and closing 
	  parentheses for control structures MUST NOT have a space before.
	  
	  Example:
	  
	  ?php
	  namespace Vendor\Package;

	  use FooInterface;
	  use BarClass as Bar;
	  use OtherVendor\OtherPackage\BazClass;

	  class Foo extends Bar implements FooInterface
	  {
      	public function sampleFunction($a, $b = null)
      	{
        	if ($a === $b) {
            	bar();
        	} elseif ($a > $b) {
            	$foo->bar($arg1);
        	} else {
            	BazClass::bar($arg2, $arg3);
        	}
      	}

      	final public static function bar()
      	{
        	// method body
      	}
	  }
	  

->Files

	- All PHP files MUST use the standard Unix LF (linefeed) termination lines.
	
	- All PHP files MUST end with a single blank line.
	
	- The closing tag ?> MUST be omitted in files containing PHP only.
	
->Indentation

	- The indentation MUST be done using tab (equivalent to 4 spaces).
	
	
->Lines

	- The line should have a maximum of 80 characters.
	
	- Lines SHOULD NOT be longer than 80 characters; Longer lines that should be divided
	  into multiple subsequent rows of no more than 80 characters each.
	  
	- SHOULD NOT be blank spaces at the end of lines that are not blank. Blank lines MAY be 
	 added to improve readability and display related code blocks.
	 
	- MUST NOT be more than one statement per line.
	
	
->Keywords and True / False / Null

	- PHP Keywords MUST be in lower case.
	
	- The PHP constants true, false and null MUST be in lower case.
	
	
->EOL Convention (End of Line)

	- End of lines MUST follow the UNIX standard, they must end with a single linefeed (LF - / n).
	

->Declaring Namespace and Use

	- When present, MUST be a blank line after the namespace declaration.

	- When present, all statements use MUST be placed after the namespace declaration.

	- MUST be only one keyword for use statement.

	- There MUST be a blank line after the block of use.
	
	Example:
	
	<?php
	namespace Vendor\Package;

	use FooClass;
	use BarClass as Bar;
	use OtherVendor\OtherPackage\BazClass;

	// ... more PHP code ...
	

->Classes, Properties and Methods

	- The term class refers to all classes, interfaces and traits.
	

	#Extends and Implements

	- Keywords extends and implements MUST be declared on the same line as the name of the class.
	
	- The key for the class MUST be placed on its own line; the closing key MUST be put on 
	  the line after the body of the class.
	  
	  Example 1:
	  
	  <?php
	  namespace Vendor\Package;

	  use FooClass;
	  use BarClass as Bar;
	  use OtherVendor\OtherPackage\BazClass;

	  class ClassName extends ParentClass implements \ArrayAccess, \Countable
	  {
	  	// constants, properties and methods
	  }
	  
	  Implements lists MAY be divided into multiple lines, where each subsequent line is 
	  indented once. When doing this, the first list item MUST be placed on the next line
	  and MUST be only one interface per line.
	    
	  Example 2:
	  
	  <?php
	  namespace Vendor\Package;

	  use FooClass;
	  use BarClass as Bar;
	  use OtherVendor\OtherPackage\BazClass;

	  class ClassName extends ParentClass implements
	  	\ArrayAccess,
      	\Countable,
      	\Serializable
	  {
      	// constants, properties and methods
	  }
